# EWLNet
The goal of this project is to study and analyse the English Wikipedia Link Data, using Python & precisely Networkx package, thge databasis used in this work could be found in the link above:

the databasis description is compromised in the same link as readme file. 
The approach which we had taken, is to divide the whole Network into such small pieces 0.1% that the default Python configuration could deal with it, in a normal desktop computer.
The first thing is the data samples visualization through a network plot. Then extracting basic features of each sample, such as degree of each node(article).
